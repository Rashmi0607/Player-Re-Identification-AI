An intelligent, real-time system for tracking and re-identifying players in sports videos using advanced simulation of object detection, tracking, and feature analysis.

---

## üéØ Key Features

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality

1. **Player Detection Simulation**
   Mimics YOLOv11 object detection, generating realistic player movement patterns.

2. **Advanced Tracking**
   Employs a Kalman filter-inspired approach combined with distance and feature-based matching to maintain player identity across frames.

3. **Re-Identification**
   Automatically re-identifies players when they leave and re-enter the frame using visual feature comparison.

4. **Real-Time Processing**
   Simulates frame-by-frame video analysis with dynamic progress tracking.

## üé® Visual Features Used

* **Color Analysis**
  Dominant color extraction helps identify jerseys and uniforms.

* **Spatial Features**
  Tracks position, size, and aspect ratio for each detected player.

* **Temporal Consistency**
  Maintains continuity through trajectory prediction and movement pattern analysis.

## üß† Smart Algorithms

* **Feature Similarity Matching**
  Combines visual attributes like color, shape, and size for identity confirmation.

* **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
  Smoothly updates player features over time to reduce noise.

* **Distance-Based Tracking**
  Preserves player identity across frames using Euclidean spatial distance.

* **Confidence Scoring**
  Evaluates reliability of detections and matches with a confidence metric.

## üîß Technical Implementation

* **Modular Architecture**
  Clean code structure with separate modules for tracking logic, video processing, and UI interaction.

* **Canvas-Based Visualization**
  Real-time drawing of bounding boxes and player IDs over video frames.

* **Progressive Enhancement**
  Includes smooth animations and responsive design elements for better UX.

* **Performance Optimization**
  Efficient handling of video frames with smart memory usage and asynchronous processing.

## üìä Analytics Dashboard

* **Real-Time Statistics**
  Displays player count, re-identification events, and tracking accuracy.

* **Player History**
  Complete tracking timeline for each detected player.

* **Visual Feedback**
  Color-coded player IDs and status indicators to monitor progress.

* **Progress Monitoring**
  Watch video analysis in real-time, frame by frame.
